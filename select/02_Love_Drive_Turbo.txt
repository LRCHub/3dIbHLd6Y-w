I don't want to go and leave a soul alone.
I don't want to go and leave you on your own.

Wait, wait, wait! Don't go just yet.
I know that you...
Hate, hate, hate being lost and left alone.

So drive with me into the night.
Get it out of sight, and out of your mind.
Underneath the starlight.
And we'll light fire to the skies.

I don't want to go, and leave a soul alone.
I don't want to go, and leave you on your own.
Anymore!

Love Drive!
I want to make my voice heard!
- All around the world.

Love Drive!
Through the flames and fire!
The voice of my desire.

Love Drive!
And I will come back to you!
Back where I belong.

Love Drive!
And you know my love for you,
will reach you through my song!

So drive with me into the night.
Get it out of sight, and out of your mind.
Underneath the starlight.
And we'll light fire to the skies.

I don't want to go, and leave a soul alone.
I don't want to go, and leave you on your own.
Anymore!

Love Drive!
I want to make my voice heard!
All around the world.

Love Drive!
Through the flames and fire!
The voice of my desire.

Love Drive!
And I will come back to you!
Back where I belong.

Love Drive!
And you know my love for you,
will reach you through my song!

Days, days, days. They pass me by.
And I pray, pray, pray, that you won't tell me your goodbyes.

So drive with me into the night.
Get it out of sight, and out of my mind.
Underneath the starlight.
Even if just for one last time.

I don't want to go, and leave a soul alone.
I don't want to go, and leave you on your own.
Anymore!

Love Drive!
I want to make my voice heard!
All around the world.

Love Drive!
Through the flames and fire!
The voice of my desire.

Love Drive!
And I will come back to you!
Back where I belong.

Love Drive!
And you know my love for you,
will reach you through my song!

Love Drive!
